This project is a RSA key generator and RSA encrypter.

You can generate public and private keys with GenerateRsaKeys.py, of the size you want, and then use them with rsa.py to encrypt and decrypt text and special characters (%, ù, ;, :, ., /, *, µ, $, £, ¤, ,...)

PS: This script isn't designed to resist bruteforcing for thousands years, so if you think about doing anything that will potentially lead you into a situation where someone is trying to bruteforce the encrypted text, just don't do that...
Enjoy it!
